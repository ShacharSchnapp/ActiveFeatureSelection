To run the experiment of active estimation of the mutual information for a single feature, use the following command line:

python3.6 experiment.py

This will run all the single-feature estimation experiments described in the paper. The output is a graph for each experiment and a mat file with the score for each algorithm
(PROP, MAX-H, MAX-B, VAR-H, VAR-B, VAR-CP, I-H, I-B, I-CP). The outputs will be saved to the following folder path: ./results

For environment setup, see the README.txt in the root of the archive.
